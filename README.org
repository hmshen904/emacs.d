- This is a minimal init file that creates a Spacemacs like setup using [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]], [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], evil, and [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]].

- Employs [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]], [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]], [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]], [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][marginalia]], and [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]] for completion.

- Uses the freshly minted org-cite citation backend along with [[https://github.com/bdarcus/citar][citar]] in org-mode. You'll need org-mode version 9.5 or later.
